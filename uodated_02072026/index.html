                    <h2>Your ESP is lying to you about engagement. This tool shows you how.</h2>

                    <p>There's a category of subscriber on your list that your ESP reports as engaged but can't be
                        verified. We call them Phantom Engaged. These are subscribers whose only engagement signal is an
                        open, in an environment where opens can be generated by machines, privacy proxies, and security
                        filters without a human ever seeing your email.</p>

                    <p>Every list has them. Most email marketers have never segmented for them. And until you do, your
                        open rates, your engagement metrics, and your re-engagement strategy are all built on a number
                        you can't trust.</p>

                    <div class="impact-examples">
                        <p><strong>What this looks like in practice:</strong></p>

                        <p>A 40,000-subscriber list with "good" open rates. Confirmed engaged subscribers after applying
                            the Phantom Engaged framework: 11,200.</p>

                        <p>An ecommerce brand sending weekly to 85,000 subscribers. They estimated 8% unengaged. Actual
                            exposure to unverified or unresponsive addresses, including phantom engaged: 31%.</p>

                        <p>A B2B newsletter with 22,000 subscribers and a "healthy" sender reputation. After
                            classification, nearly half their "engaged" segment couldn't be verified with any signal
                            beyond an open.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Until recently, there was no structured way to identify these subscribers, separate them from
                        your audience that's actually paying attention, or re-engage them without putting your sender
                        reputation at risk. That's what this framework was built to solve. The plan this tool generates
                        is specific to your list, your sending patterns, and your available data, and it gives you a
                        step-by-step path that didn't exist before.</p>

                    <h2>Your Re-Engagement Snapshot</h2>
                    <p>
                        You're sending <span class="var-freq-lowercase"></span> to <span
                            class="var-remaining-count"></span> subscribers. You've identified roughly <span
                            class="var-unengaged-count"></span> of them, about <span class="var-unengaged-pct"></span>%
                        of
                        your audience, as showing no meaningful engagement signals. That leaves <span
                            class="var-remaining-count"></span> that you're currently treating as engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That second number deserves scrutiny. It's almost certainly too high, and the framework below
                        will show you exactly why.

                            without this new structured re-engagement process in place, you have no mechanism for

                        Engagement classification has fundamentally changed. Open rates are no longer a reliable proxy
                        for human interest due to privacy protections like Apple's MPP.
                        In this environment, aggressive re-engagement can damage domain reputation.
                        We adhere to a conservative, signal-first approach to protect list health while attempting to
                        recover value.
                        This goal is long term stability, not short term volume.

                        <strong>Why this matters for your list:</strong> The instinct is to treat your list as 2 groups,
                        engaged and unengaged. Both your ESP and your gut reinforce that view. But it's wrong.

                        <span class="var-remaining-count"></span> as engaged. <strong>But a significant portion of that
                            group
                            is 100% Phantom Engaged:</strong> subscribers whose &ldquo;opens&rdquo; are generated by
                        privacy proxies,
                        not human behavior.

                    <p>
                        The actual number of confirmed engaged subscribers on your list is likely

                        This framework splits your list into 3 buckets, not 2. The middle bucket, Phantom
                        Engaged, is the one most email marketers have never considered. It's also the one that
                        determines whether your re-engagement effort helps or hurts. Here, let me show you what I mean:

                        ones with no signals at all. That's Bucket C, and it's where the stakes are highest. The wrong
                        approach here doesn't just fail to recover subscribers. It actively damages your ability to
                        reach the ones who are still paying attention.</p>

                        temptation is to re-engage them all at once and &ldquo;get it over with.&rdquo; But if you send
                        to all <span class="var-unengaged-count"></span> simultaneously, that's a <span
                            class="var-unengaged-pct"></span>% spike in volume hitting addresses that haven't responded
                        to you in months. ISPs don't just penalize that batch. They throttle delivery to your entire
